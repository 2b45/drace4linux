The "notifier" provider provides a means to intercept the kernel
"notifier" functions. These functions are used to broadcast a state
notification to interested parties. Drivers can define their own notifier
lists, and the kernel provides a number of default notifiers, e.g. to
notify when a task exits, or a cpu switch occurs.
