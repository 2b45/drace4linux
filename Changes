Wed Jun 22 21:18:17 2011  fox

     527* tests/syscalls.c: i386 now invokes sigreturn() syscall - which is
          panicing the 64b kernel...off to fix that.

     525* tools/mksyscalls.pl: Updates for 2.6.18 kernel.

     524* dtrace_linux.c, x_call.c: Fixes for 2.6.18 kernel and >8 cpus.

     523* driver/intr_x86*.S: Add cnt_nmi1/cnt_nmi2 so we can see if we are
          called.

          when theres no /lib/modules/ver/source directory (for Centos 4).

     518* driver/x_call.c: Lockless implementation. Use NCPU*NCPU*2
          xcalls array to avoid interference with parallel xcalls from

	  some syscalls, especially the pt_regs calls for a 32b binary

          cleanup the ptregs calls - dont think we need the special
	  patching code.

	  Tested on Ubuntu 10.04 only so far.

     503* systrace.c: Revamp for 32-bit kernels, so that we dont
          get occasional ERESTART issues on syscalls.

	  This took a lot of effort to get going, but the code is
	  better for 32-bit kernels. Now off to refix the 64-bit
	  kernels.

Sat May 14 08:38:13 2011  fox

     502* systrace.c: Fix bug where we overwrote the saved underlyer
          when doing a syscall trace, and another /usr/sbin/dtrace does
	  something unrelated (like 'dtrace -l').

Tue May 10 23:05:18 2011  fox

     501* systrace.c: Avoid two user-mode dtraces causing syscall interception
          to point to itself and hang/panic/stack overflow the kernel.

Mon Apr 25 12:14:15 2011  fox

     500* dtrace_linux.c: dtrace_xcall: Take out the local_irq_enable causing
          load-time kernel warnings to be displayed.

     499* systrace.c: Fix 32-bit syscalls on 64-bit kernel causing possible
          coredumps (saw this on exit/exitgroup syscall).

     498* dtrace_linux.c: Disable the new xcall code - it wont/cannot work
          since if we fire a timer on another cpu, the timer may not
	  fire until we exit the current interrupt. The other
	  code seems better, (having enabled irq's), lets see how well.

     495* driver/systrace.c: Rework the syscall trampoline code to
          avoid RAX/EAX corruptions, along with some other fixes.

     494* driver/dtrace_linux.c: Implement out own safe dtrace_xcall
          using cross-cpu timers. Not brilliant, but seems to avoid
	  deadlocks or kernel warnings. We have a deadman timeout to
	  avoid real deadlocks. (We occasionally see the impossible in a 
	  VM where timers dont fire or fire too late; I think we handle
	  this ok). dtrace_xcalls are not that frequent, so it should have
	  minimal performance decrease.

Tue Apr 19 21:04:57 2011  fox

     493* driver/systrace.c: Rewrite syscall wrappers to handle OpenSuse
          kernel - this method appears to be better/more generic for
	  all other platforms.

	  Code is looking messy - dups of functions and horrible 32/64 
	  ifdefs and will look to clean up at a later date.

     483* intr_x86-64.S: Better detection in dtrace_memcpy_with_error
     	  that we had been aborted (%rcx != 0)

     482* driver/dtrace.c: dtrace_load##bits: More accurate
          transcription of fault handling when we have a bad address. Werent
	  quite copying what on/usr/src/uts/i86pc/ml/locore.s does -
	  we needed to set the CPU_DTRACE_NOFAULT flag because the
	  dtrace_memcpy_with_error() wont be processed by the Linux
	  exception table, so we need to avoid propagating the page faults.

     470* driver/dtrace_isa.c: Add some safety checks around the stack
          probing so we cannot trigger a kernel pgfault (but a Dtrace intercepted
	  one is ok).

     469* driver/dtrace_linux.c: Add fixed dtrace_int13_handler and add
          dtrace_int11_handler (not sure we need this, for segment-not-present).
	  Add counters to /proc/dtrace/stats to allow us to see these firing.

     468* driver/instr_linux.c: Add support for LIDT instruction probes
          (either it doesnt work, or there arent any in 64-bit space which
	  the disassembler finds; will fix later - I wanted it to help debug
	  early version of the pgfault handler problem).

          fault code on the stack.

          definition so that it works with etc/io.d. 

	  etc/io.d: Now works to trace elements of fileinfo_t, dev_t, and
	  bufinfo_t (io probe provider).

	  the VFS read/write syscalls, and I need to see if Solaris is doing

	  work.

Mon Aug 16 21:48:52 2010  fox

     396* dtrace.c: Rework the dtrace_loadNNbits functions to avoid taking
          a segmentation violation if user is being nasty (or a bug
	  in a translator), by using the Linux validation framework.
	  This gives us a win over Solaris as we dont have to check toxic
	  ranges. Could optimise further for the 8/16/32 bit case to avoid
	  the call to dtrace_memcpy_with_error(), but probably
	  most of the time its a 64-bit move (on a 64b kernel) so not
	  a big loss. Maybe we will optimise one day when we can profile
	  if it is a real rather than an imaginary problem.

Mon Aug  9 23:27:04 2010  fox

          better to avoid false positives.

     391* Psymtab.c: Dont use a.out for the app name in stack dumps, use
          /proc/pid/exe. 

Sun Aug  8 10:46:01 2010  fox

          get the correct symbol sizes, to help ustack().

     385* dtrace_isa.c: Remove the dwarf test code and use a different algorithm
     	  for 64-bit stacks - more in line with what the kernel does on stack dumps.
	  (stack() function).

Fri Aug  6 21:55:59 2010  fox

          user level segmentation violations and report back to the user.

Wed Aug  4 23:10:26 2010  fox

     381* libproc/Pcontrol.c: Dont ptrace(ATTACH) to a proc if we want readonly
          mode. (Avoid ustack() hanging procs).

     380* dtrace.h, dt_consume.c: Add stacksymbols option from Apple to turn
          off symbolic stack traces. (Debugging or speed up).

     379* dtrace_asm.c: Avoid kernel GPF if given a bad user addr to copy.
          Not perfect as we should generate a DTRACE fault - but cannot
	  simulate this just yet.

          for the probe from user space. Now io::start has the right
	  arg0, arg1, ..., but we still havent made available a working
	  io.d and no fileinfo_t (etc) args.

          stdout.

     368* scripts/mkinstall.pl: Install /usr/lib/dtrace/ regs.d, signal.d,
          unistd.d

     367* instr_linux.c: Same as #366 - avoid aliasing issues.
          These changes fixed an issue where a fbt::do_sync_read:return
	  would never fire, because the SDT provider was stealing the probe
	  despite it not having been enabled.

          we avoid aliasing issues if fbt is probing the same instruction.

          going to single step, since some instructions may execute
	  that even if the single-step trap flag is set. E.g.
	  "MOV %CR3,%EAX".

Mon Jul 26 15:38:00 2010  fox

     363* uncompress.c, mkport.pl: Allow us to not have zlib functions in 
          kernel. Dtrace mostly works without this, but may affect the 
	  ctf functions.

          when calling this inline asm. Seems to cure the problem on
	  line 1259 (instr_in_text_seg) where we GPF'd if we didnt

          process shadowing code, so that when we use predicates such
	  as

	  dtrace -n 'syscall::: /pid == NNN/ {}'

	  that we can actually intercept the targetted process and not
	  confuse dtrace_probe when we share the shadow structure.

     304* Various: change dprintf() to be dprintf1() because GLIBC
          likes to break working apps and defines a POSIX dprintf().
	  POSIX like to break working apps too, and should be ashamed
	  of themselves.

     303* systrace.c, dtrace_linux.c: Make the pt_regs available to 
          dtrace_probe() so we can access register specific state.
	  Handle nesting of interrupts (so we dont destroy the
	  pt_regs pointer in the event of an interrupt on a syscall).

          this and can do it with per-cpu allocation instead.
	  (par_setup_thread1).

     300* cpu_x86.c: Fixed the issue with CALLR and the other call
          instructions which manipulate the stack as we step over them.
	  32 and 64 bit kernels should be safe - til we hit another
	  instruction we have never seen before.

     290* dtrace_linux.c, intr_x86*.S: Add support for INT13 (GPF), so
          we can disable ourselves when we run into issues.

          entry point and if we probe it, we may get a kernel double-fault
	  because the stack wont be ready for kernel space.

Fri May 29 19:50:52 2009  fox

     284* dtrace_linux.c: Dont do RIP addressing mode for 32-bit cpu.

Sat May 23 19:18:09 2009  fox

     283* intr_x86-32.S, intr_x86-64.S: Add a dummy mcount function
          in case kernel is compiled with -pg. We mustnt call into
	  the kernels mcount else we hit a recursion error.

     282* fbt_linux.c: Re-enable more x86-64 opcodes which were disabled
          whilst debugging the interrupt handlers.

     281* fbt_linux.c, dtrace_linux.c, cpuvar.h: Compute modrm byte

          the debug streams into separate entries (debug, security, stats, trace).
	  This is easier to handle >4K reads for the trace buffer.

Sun May 17 20:51:17 2009  fox

     276* dtrace_linux.c: Add support for RIP relative addressing mode
          single step.

     275* dtrace_linux.c: Add dtrace_memcpy to avoid reentrancy issues when
          we probe memcpy(). This happens because we use this inside our
	  single step handler.

     274* fasttrap.c: Avoid kernel panic when invoking a USDT since
          we are tuned to the number of cpus, not the max of cpus we
	  could have.

Fri May 15 21:56:07 2009  fox

	  root to talk to the kernel.

	  Please edit /etc/dtrace.conf - it contains my uid in there which

     265* dtrace_linux.c: par_alloc: We had some static initialisation
          in here which was breaking predicates for processes.
	  The process shadowing was broken - we kept cleaning out
	  the predicate hints. Now, when doing

	  dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null

	  dtrace -n 'syscall::read: /pid == 7331/ {printf("pid=%d", pid);}'

	  we get consistent read:entry + read:return pairs, and we
	  dont just stop probe collecting.

	  Thanks to <mauritz.sundell@viem.se> for pointing out this
	  obvious silliness on my behalf.

     264* dtrace_linux.c, fbt_linux.c, sdt_linux.c: If we have a recursive
          probe, then when we disable the probe, dont let it fire !
	  Else we get multiple recursions leading to a cpu triple fault.

	  This seems to fix the 32-bit instability issue, and let me see
	  where the recursion issue has happened.

     207* dtrace_linux.c: Undo last change - it wasnt what the problem was.
          Problem is that an SMP kernel may say we have 64 cpus, when we
	  only have 1 or 2, so buffer allocation went thru the roof -- 
	  64 * 4MB of RAM, and we OOM'ed. Now we utilise number of online
	  cpus at driver load time. (We need to do work if we online
	  cpus whilst system is up, since the arrays will be too small).

     206* dtrace.c: Do some rough memory calcs when allocating the state

     191* fbt_linux.c, dtrace_linux.c: Add on_notifier_list() to 
          detect if a target probe point is on one of our notifier
	  chains, and will cause kernel mayhem if we probe it.

Sat Mar  7 09:02:09 2009  fox

     190* missing.c: Add strlen(), and strncmp() for older kernels/gcc's.

     189* fbt_linux.c: When examining module symbols, ignore any in
          the ".init" sections, else we can be trying to touch reclaimed
	  pages.

     188* fbt_linux.c: Dont allow us to create probes for module "init"
          functions which are likely sitting in unmapped pages. This
	  caused problems in dtrace_close() as we tried to unpatch them,
	  but they may not be mapped or contain data since the pages would
	  have been freed.

     187* tools/load.pl, dtrace_linux.c: Add a -mem_alloc option
          to turn on memory tracing. (Its too voluminous if enabled
	  with -here).

     186* fbt_linux.c:fbt_disable: Dont unpatch a probe we never

     127* ctl.c: Disable the hunt_init/hunt_cleanup code for the moment
          as its crashing the x86 cpu (32b).

     126* dtrace_asm.c: Found an issue with the membar functions which
          dont work on a real x86(32b) cpu, but do on a VMware
	  session on a 64b processor, and in 64bit mode. Use SFENCE
	  instruction.

          into here. Need to cater for older kernels and i386/x86-64 too.

Sun Feb  1 15:28:56 2009  fox

     122* Various: tidy up some kernel compile warnings; remove some
          unneeded zero length headers. 

	  Arrange for proc_exit notification to wipe out fasttrap
	  probes.

     121* Various: refactor datamodel computation because we may treat
          a 64b proc as a 32b one and access the wrong values for 
	  copyinstr().

	  We still have some USDT issues: dtrace doesnt know the target
	  proc exited, so leaves the probes behind.

Sat Dec 27 04:35:47 2008  fox

      78* makefile: Build libelf/Gelf structures properly for 32b machines.

Sun Jul 27 08:56:23 2008  fox

      77* dtrace_isa.c: Add in support for getstack to handle stack()
          calls. Not brilliant with -fomit-frame-pointer in the kernel,
	  but that will teach people to use this option :-(

      76* dt_module.c: Add support for reading /proc/kallsyms so we
          can get kernel level stack traces.

Thu Jul 24 08:54:01 2008  fox

      75* dtrace.c: dtrace_probe: Fix issue with 32-bit arguments
          not being sign extended when stored in return struct. Without
	  this, arg0 is never < 0 for failed syscalls.

      74* load.pl: rewrite load shell script as perl as we want to do some
          extra things for some kernels.

      73* fbt_linux.c: Add support for i386/modules[] on 2.6.23.1

Wed Jul 23 07:32:30 2008  fox

      72* fbt_linux.c: Implement work around for 2.6.23.1 kernel
          without public sys_call_table.

      71* dtrace_linux.c: par_alloc should memset the memory
          to zero to avoid firing a signal when it wasnt asked for.

      70* systrace.c, dtrace.c: Implement support for raise/stop actions
          which can send a signal to a process.

      69* load: Detect missing symbols and try to warn user something
          may fail.

Wed Jul 16 22:55:01 2008  fox

      68* systrace.c: Avoid bogus syscalls which can index
          off the end of the array. Likely due to bad stack reference.
	  Avoids SIGKILL near kernel panic when it happens.
	  Trying to bootstrap ustack() call which involves 
	  examining to the proc in user space to grab the symbol
	  table. Race condition (which is catered for) -- the proc
	  may no longer exist by the time dtrace is running.

      66* Pisadep.c: Got rid of most of our stubs and use proper libproc
          code. This code wont work since its depending on Solaris /procfs
	  but we can start to work our way through this.

Sat Jul 12 10:59:36 2008  fox

      65* Archive: 1.0039

          call ustack() without starting to emulate /procfs on Solaris.

      62* dtrace_isa.c: Fix issue with coying to/from user space.

          to fix before we can use this.

          function. Next, get fasttrap_isa.c to compile.

Sat Jul  5 14:53:52 2008  fox

      58* dtrace.c, dtrace_linux.c: Implement a parallel shadow to curthread
          so we dont die when doing thread local variables (dt9 test).
	  We now need a garbage collector - otherwise we may leak memory,
	  or have an issue when a new thread comes along on the same address.

	  dt9: demo/vars/rtime.d no longer panics the kernel.

Fri Jul  4 20:35:34 2008  fox

      57* dt_lex.l: Another attempt at fixing the lexing issues with

          20080623.

      55* Move cmd/dtrace/demo to toplevel dir so its more accessible.
          Create tools/runtests.sh so we can start proving the quality
	  of the yacc/lex port.

      54* Archive: 1.0032

      53* profile.c: Now shows up in dtrace -l; allow us to talk to
          /dev/dtrace_profile driver to change max profile probes.

Wed Jul  2 20:46:02 2008  fox

      52* profile.c: Add missing profile driver. Not yet proven and the
          omni support is missing...

      51* utils/libgcc.pl: Script to locate your libgcc.a file rather than
          me supply one.

      50* Mojmir Svoboda: Fix for raw_local_irq_disable() /
          raw_local_irq_enable() to be more backward kernel compliant.
	  Mojmir suggests issues with kmem_cache_create - I think kernel
	  code changed function calling so need to incorporate a kernel
	  specific fix.

Tue Jul  1 21:53:15 2008  fox

      49* dt_lex.l: Lets hope this works because I am mightily sick
         of flex - getting it to work on all platforms. Its an
	 embarrassment.

      47* put dtrace binary in build/ directory.

      46* dt_lex.l, makefile, dt_impl.h: Get lex to build us properly so

Thu Jun 26 22:51:51 2008  fox

      36* Various: changes to build 32-bit dtrace + driver

Mon Jun 16 22:57:02 2008  fox

      35* cyclic.c: Need the full whack from Solaris. Without this, the
          D Engine will kill us after a while because it thinks we are hanging
	  and may endanger the system stability.

	  We could just write our own, but its doing a lot of complex
	  and well thought out issues to do with accuracy and 
	  cpu alignment, and its not worth hacking this. FreeBSD has
	  its own (slightly simplified) version of the Solaris code.

Sun Jun 15 09:39:19 2008  fox

      34* dtrace_linux.c, fbt_linux.c: Add a (slow/horrid) parallel 
          allocator. Avoids reprobing modules.

          since we were dying due to bad VM inside the kernel.

Mon Jun  2 21:42:23 2008  fox

      23* Archive: 1.0020

Wed May 28 22:31:37 2008  fox

      22* drivers/dtrace/dtrace_ioctl.c: Remove this - integrate back in
          with dtrace.c since we are now more aligned and nearly working.

Mon May 26 14:31:54 2008  fox

      21* drivers/dtrace/*: Fix issue where 'dtrace -l' would keep
          adding the same probes. Needed to mimic the init/attach/open
	  cycle of a proper solaris driver. Fixed various crashes due
	  to this, and allows driver to unload properly - no issues in simple
	  testing, but basic probe placement is not working yet - cannot 
	  plant the probes. Not sure why..yet.

Sun May 25 00:35:12 2008  fox

      20* drivers/dtrace.c: Update to latest opensolaris code to help

      19* Archive: 1.0018

Tue May 20 23:50:24 2008  fox

      18* cmd/dtrace/dtrace.c: Incorporate getopt() fixes from Apple/Darwin.
          Fixes 'dtrace -n BEGIN', but note this will presently crash your
	  kernel if you run it !

Tue May 13 21:56:09 2008  fox

      17* cmd/dtrace/dtrace.c: Fix issue with getopt() not working when
          presented with this command line:

	  cmd/dtrace/dtrace cmd/dtrace/demo/agg/denorm.d /bin/ls

      16* Update the cmd/dtrace demo to the latest version. They broke
          backwards compatibility ! Why ?! The #pragma changed syntax.
	  Thats very very naughty of them. I do hate lex+flex.

Sun May 11 20:54:47 2008  fox

          files from my install tree to the remote install tree.

       8* Archive: 1.0006

       7* Put all binaries into the build/ dir rather than littering the
          source. Not done for drivers yet, since Linux kernel build
	  pollutes us. Also made code do a clean build from start to finish.
	  Ignore warnings - will address these over the course of time.

       6* Archive: 1.0005

       5* Various changes for clean build on FC8/2.6.24.4 kernel. Slightly
          broken Ubuntu...to fix next. First part of the driver works, and
	  making some changes to allow cmd/dtrace to talk to the driver.

Mon Apr 21 22:10:40 2008  fox

       4* Surprise: my first kernel panic. /dev/dtrace is the interface
          and if you cat it ... surprise !

Sun Apr 20 20:51:52 2008  fox

       3* Now builds under ubuntu 2.6.22-14-generic kernel and
          RedHat FC* 2.6.24.4-64.fc8. More portability.

	  If you load the driver, you will have 

	  /proc/dtrace/helper
	  /proc/dtrace/dtrace

	  entries. (Non functional since no plumbing at present).

Sat Apr 19 23:08:09 2008  fox

       2* drivers/dtracedrv.ko finally links correctly. However theres still
          quite a few stubs and broken definitions, so be careful - will
	  likely crash your kernel.

Wed Apr  9 21:56:09 2008  fox

       1* dt_lex.l: Fix flex/lex issues - now parses strings properly and
           dtrace -x nolibs -n BEGIN -e -S
	   seems to work - or at least it doesnt core dump or generate
	   a diagnostic.
